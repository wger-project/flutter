        'Exercising with a friend or loved one can make it more fun, and increase your chances of sticking to your exercise plan. Exercising with a friend is a great way to keep you motivated. It’s also a great way to meet new people. It can even save you money. Exercise with someone around the same fitness level as you so you can spur each other on. Ask a family member or a friend, or join a sporting club or group.',
