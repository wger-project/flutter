Your Workouts:
You know what is best for your body. Create your own workouts out of a growing variety from 200 different exercises. Then, use the Gym Mode to guide you through the training while you log your weights with one tap.

Your Progress:
Never lose sight of your goals. Track your weight and keep your statistics.

Your Data:
wger is your personalized fitness diary – but you own your data. Use the REST API to access and do amazing things with it.

Please note: This free app is not based on additional fundings and we don’t ask you to donate money. More than that it is a community project which is growing constantly. So be prepared for new features anytime!
