## Developing and contributing

Our goal is to build an awesome and flexible fitness and nutrition manager,
along with a comprehensive list of exercises and ingredients, all released
under a free license.

For this, we’d love your help! Whether it’s code, translations, exercises or
reporting issues and ideas, check out our
[contribution guide](https://wger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)
to get started.

A huge thank you to everyone who has contributed so far! ❤️ See the full list
in [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md).

**TLDR**

```bash
flutter run
```

This is a regular flutter application, so there's no magic. You will need a backend
for this, so feel free to use the test server for this (the db is reset daily):

* URL: `https://wger-master.rge.uber.space`
* username: `user`
* password: `flutteruser`

## Translation

Translate the app to your language on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/wger/).
